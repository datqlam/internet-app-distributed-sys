                     <p>Spinning is a form of indoor cycling that is offered in large gym chains and boutique fitness clubs across the country.

                     <p>Boxing is a powerful alternative to cross-training workouts. This empowering exercise often includes free weights and plyometric moves — quick exercises that exert lots of force, such as hopping and jumping — to maximize calorie burn and increase lean muscle mass. Participants focus on improving speed, mental and physical strength, coordination, and endurance with this combat-based, total-body workout that only draws the line at full-contact sparring.</p>

                     <p>Zumba combines Latin dance, hip-hop, martial arts, and resistance training in an upbeat fitness choreography that makes working out tons of fun. A typical, 60-minute class helps relieve stress, tone muscles, and burn calories. Appropriate for all ages and fitness levels, it’s no wonder that this confidence-boosting, rhythmic workout is such a hit.</p>

                     <p>This low-impact, conditioning workout is filled with body-sculpting moves that only require a space the size of an exercise mat. Instructors help participants connect the mind and body through a series of small, breath-controlled movements that help build flexibility, muscle strength, and endurance in the legs, abs, arms, hips, and back. Most classes emphasize the importance of achieving proper pelvic and spinal alignment, resulting in improved posture.</p>
